Identifying the ship's manoeuvring dynamics can be used to build models for ship manoeuvrability prediction. The identification can be decomposed into finding a suitable Vessel Manoeuvring Model (VMM) for the hydrodynamic forces and to correctly handle errors from the measurement noise. 
In this paper, a Parameter Identification Technique (PIT) is proposed to identify  the VMM parameters (hydrodynamic derivatives) from measured model test trajectories and thrust. The most suitable VMM is found by using the PIT with cross validation on a set of competing VMMs.
In the proposed PIT, the data noise from model tests or full-scale measurements are solved by combing the inverse dynamics regression and Extended Kalman Filter with a RTS smoother. The multicollinearity problems in the VMMs are addressed by reducing the number of parameters and introducing the thrust force models. Two case study vessels: wPCC and KVLCC2 with very different maneuverability characteristics are used to demonstrate and validate the proposed method. 
Turning circle is used as the prediction case for both ships. Robust VMMs identified on model test data (excluding turning circle) show good agreement with the corresponding model test results for both ships.
