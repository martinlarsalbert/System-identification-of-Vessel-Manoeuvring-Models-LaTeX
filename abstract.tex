Different Vessel Manoeuvring Models (VMMs) and their model parameters have been studied by various system identification methods but mainly based on simulation data. In this paper, a robust VMM with proper parameters (hydrodynamic derivatives) is first chosen to describe a shipâ€™s manoeuvring. To estimate the model parameters. In the proposed method, the data noise from model tests or full-scale measurements are solved by combing the inverse dynamics regression and Extended Kalman Filter with a RTS smoother. The multicollinearity problems in the VMMs are addressed by introducing the thrust force models for different ship types. Two case study vessels with very different manoeuverability characteristics are used to demonstrate and validate the proposed method to build a VMM for their manoeuver.
